    <p>Coming in to this class, I have only a basic knowledge of HTMl and CSS from taking WRA 210. I have no experience yet with JavaScript.</p>
    
    <p>This semester, I'd like to learn more about JavaScript, and just more about web development in general. I've created a few small websites as a hobby, but I've never made a site that has any interactivity or functionality beyond basic HTML.</p>
